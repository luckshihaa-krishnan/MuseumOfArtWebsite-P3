## MuseumOfArtWebsite-P3

This is the fourth and final project I did in the course which is a continuation of 'Museum Of Art - Part 2' (https://github.com/luckshihaa-krishnan/MuseumOfArtWebsite-P2). In this application, I added a Register and Login feature which allows users to have an account. This allows users to keep their favoured artworks and search history stored in their account and will not be erased unless they unfavour or erase the search history. The user can login, favourite their desired artwork, view their search history, and when they logout and log back in, the favourites and search history will be the same and not be empty. 

If the user does not have an account, they can click the register button on the top right of the application which will direct them to a form to register. The user can now enter their desired username and password to have them registered in this application. After registering, it will automatically direct the user to the login page which contains another form for the user to login to access the artworks. After logging in, the user now has access to the application and has the ability to view, search, and favour artworks, and see their search history. In the dropdown that contains 'Favourites' and 'Search History', there is another option that says 'Log Out' which users can click when they are done with this application. Once the user logs out, they can click 'Login' instead of 'Register' and enter their user and password and continue looking at more artworks.

Overall, inputting a Register and Login feature is an advantage for users as their favoured artworks and search history will always be there, compared to 'Museum Of Art - Part 2', when the user exits the application, their favoured artworks and search history would be erased.

The command to run this application is 'npm run dev'. After this command is typed in the terminal, it will give a link to where we can see the application (for example, localhost:3000). This link would lead us to the application in the browser.
